# Dynamic-Virtual-Gesture-System

# Abstract

With new changes seen in engineering field day by day, it become quite important for society to search out specific new ways in which of interaction with computer systems and technology as its need is increasing in society everyday. Today, all device is creating the application of touch screen technology on its computer systems, that is not affordable to be employed in every applications. A particular system sort of a virtual mouse that generates  object pursuit(tracking) and Gestures which will ease us to interact, it can be an alternate technique for the typical touch screen and also the solid physical mouse. the target is to make associate Object pursuit(tracking) application that interacts with the computer system.This system proposed is a Computer Vision-based control system, that uses hand gestures that are being captured from a digital camera through associate with hand detection technique implemented using OpenCV libraries.

Our project which applies gesture recognition as a topic which comes under two computer science fields like augmented reality and human-computer interaction and we have created a virtual gesture system with the goal of elucidating human gestures through the mathematical algorithms. Users can use simple finger or hand gestures to control or interact with the system without physically touching them and also we included a voice assistance to start and end the gesture controlling system. Gesture recognition can be viewed as a way for computers to begin to recognize human body language and signs, thus stuffing the void between computing systems and humans than earliest text user interfaces or even graphical user interfaces, which still limit the majority of input to keyboard and mouse are may not be very efficient at all times.

The algorithm is focused on deep learning for detecting the gestures. Hence, the proposed system will avoid pandemic situation of COVID-19 spread by reducing the human interaction with the devices to control the system.

# Module Description

We have devised a smart framework for creating a virtual interface in this paper. As the cases of covid-19 are decreasing maximum public places are opening with half or full capacity. ATMs are always open. If we install this system in the public places like ticket counters, ATMs and computerized docking facilities, the spread of germs, bacteria, and viruses can be greatly reduced. The block diagram of the developed framework is depicted
+ 1. Hand Detection In this module, the main focus is access the webcam and allow the program to access the hand images. 
+ 2. Gesture Detection and Recognition In this module, the accessed images are analysed and the movements and the significant gestures are noted and stored. 
+ 3. Accessing The Database To Check Verify Gesture In this module, the recorded gestures and movements are cross-checked with the pre- programmed gestures and movements to facilitate the program functioning 
+ 4. Desired Actions Occur In this module, the cross-checked gestures are triggered to perform the preprogramed actions like moving cursor, scrolling, clicking, double clicking, etc.. 
+ 5. Help From Voice Assistance In this module, we create a voice assistant to facilitate and help us use the virtual interface more efficiently and safely. It can also perform many other basic functions
